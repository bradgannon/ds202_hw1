2. I consider data science to be the study of data and analyzing it to make conclusion that affect decisions being made. I think it is both a qualitative and quantitative field, with discretion being very important to a data scientist. Furthermore, it blends both **programming** and business in a professional setting, which I find to be very interesting. An example of this would be analyzing financial data to determine algorithms for approving/denying loans for people. Here is a link to a chart that would be created by a data scientist to understand data:
